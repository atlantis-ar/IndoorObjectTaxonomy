# IndoorObjectTaxonomy
Taxonomy of indoor objects (building elements, furniture, accessories)

We provide the ontology in tabular form (TSV, XLSX) and as RDF/OWL XML. The HTML file provides a hierarchical view of the data.

The taxonomy has been created from the following sources:
- [Furniture Sector Ontology (FSO) 2.5.1](http://www.funstep.org/ontology/)
- [MS COCO](https://cocodataset.org/) Concepts
- [Scannet Concepts](http://www.scan-net.org/) (including the NYU40 set)
- we use [Wordnet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) as a pivot to connect the vocabularies from different domains

The taxonomy has been created from these sources in a semi-automatic way.

For compatibility with FSO we continue using the BSD 3-clause license.
